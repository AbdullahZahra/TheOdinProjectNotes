# Introduction & Background

Documenting my journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard "A great open source curriclum to learn web developmen"). I intend to complete the [Full Stack JavaScript Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript "Full Stack JavaScript Path").

My decision came after a year of continuous trials to enter the backend field. I've studied .Net Core, Laravel, and had a brief time with Ruby. After a year I find myself lack so many skills that allow me to be a backend developer. I knew The Odin Project but I didn't commit to it so long. But after I realized how much time I wasted studying so much but learning so little I decided to settle with this curriclum and its exercises as I never found a better source.
